## 📌 About
The goal of this project is to test and explore different algorithms and data processing methods in the context of ML.

## 🧪 Experiments
### 1. Handwritten digit recognition experiment using the kNN Classification Algorithm
The first experiment involves using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for digit recognition. The model is trained on the `sklearn.datasets.load_digits` dataset and is used to classify images representing digits (0-9).

```

Steps:
1. Load the `sklearn.datasets.load_digits` dataset
2. Data preprocessing (normalization, splitting into training and test sets)
3. Implement the KNN classifier
4. Evaluate the model performance
